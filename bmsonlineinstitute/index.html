                    BMS covers a wide range of curriculum ranging from arts subjects to science subjects which are all WAEC standards.
                    The idea is to create an avenue for people who are not opportune to attend conventional classroom school to still have the opportunity to access secondary school level of education with the same level of knowledge and practical exposure.
                    We guarantee an optimal learning environment with a comprehensive student-teacher feedback system. Students would also have the opportunity to choose from a variety of skills available to learn one.
                    What's best about all this, is that guardians/parents have the freedom of paying the fees installmentally at no extra cost.
                    To enroll now, kindly click on the link below and fill the form and we would be in touch with further details.
