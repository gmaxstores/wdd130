    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
    <p>I'm a Nigerian and i reside in the south-south region of Nigeria. I'm a dentist but currently studying computer and web programming. I love reading science-related books, dancing and listening to soul-styrring hymns. I'm single. Like i said, I'm a dentist and currently doing my internship</p>
    <p>The one thing I love about BYUI is that it is well structured and organised with a lot of help and study resources. The tech industry is an industry with exponential growth and I intend to key into this industry in order to increase my career options.</p>
    <p>That's a little bit about my humble self. Thank you for visiting my page.</p>
